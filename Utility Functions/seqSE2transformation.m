%seqSE2transformation compute a sequence of SE2 transformations given in a left-to-right stacked input array
function [out_arr] = seqSE2transformation(in_arr)
    %   Each column in the array corresponds to the group element operation from left to right. The columns are SE2 vectors, so they need to be converted into their
    %   corresponding matrix forms to act on each other.
